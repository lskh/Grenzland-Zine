46.656 Psychedelic Landscapes
.PP
Back in 2021 when I was preparing for a 
.I "Traveller5"
campaign I binge watched
.I "Star Trek", 
the original series and read
.I "Dune"
and a couple of other novels by
.I "Poul Anderson" , 
.I "Jack Vance" ,
and parts of the
.I
Darkover Series
.R
by 
.I "Marion Zimmer Bradley" . 
As to the visuals that go along with these stories, just do an image search for “science fiction landscapes” or
“psychedelic landscape” ... see what I mean?
I just adore those retro-futuristic, quite possibly substance induced visions of the
future, conceived in our own 1960ies to 1980ies.
This is Science Fantasy to me!
To inject these awesome visuals into our gaming I came up with the following
d66 table. My idea was to roll on this table when ever the characters would
land on a new world. I'm not sure if I used it even once while we played, but I still like it, and I feel it's a perfect fit for this issue.

Interestingly back then AI generated art hadn't caught on yet. Midjourney was
only released in 2022. But looking at the options we have today, rolling up a
couple of descriptions might make for interesting prompts. Personally I'd much rather
just imagine how this would lool like, or work out a shared imagination together with 
our gaming group. That's the best!

Just in case you don’t know what d66 stands for: this is a random table to be
used with two six sided dice. Roll once for each collumn, and just roll two
regular dice and read the first one as tens (a 5 becomes 50 for example) and
the second die as ones (just read as is). You could use differently colored
dice, so you can tell which one denotes the tens. I simply roll which ever two
dice I can grab and read the one that lands more leftish of the other as tens.

Have fun spacing out!
